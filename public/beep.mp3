This is a placeholder file. You'll need to add an actual MP3 beep sound file here.

You can find free beep sounds online at places like:
- https://freesound.org/browse/tags/beep/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/beep/

Download a beep sound and name it 'beep.mp3' and place it in your public folder.
